# UI Test Automation

In our test automation framework, we leveraged Cucumber, Selenium, and TestNG to conduct UI Testing for web applications. We implemented the Page Object Model (POM) for better test structure, improving maintainability and reusability. Using Gherkin syntax, we defined user-friendly scenarios for behavior-driven testing, ensuring seamless test execution across different browsers. Our automated tests covered functional flows, form validations, UI responsiveness, and user interactions, verifying that the front-end behaved as expected across various use cases. TestNG was used for parallel execution and reporting, ensuring efficient test execution and result tracking.

# API Test Automation

API Testing Description:
For API Testing, we utilized Cucumber, RestAssured, and TestNG to validate backend services and endpoints. Using Gherkin-based test scenarios, we ensured that REST APIs met functional, security, and performance requirements. RestAssured facilitated seamless API request handling, allowing us to perform GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations while validating status codes, response payloads, and headers. Test data was parameterized for dynamic validation, and TestNG provided structured execution and reporting. This approach ensured that the AI-driven services and other backend functionalities worked reliably and integrated smoothly with the UI.
